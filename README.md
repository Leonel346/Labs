Final Project has a task manager.

This was done with four objects:
1. Add task
2. Completed task
3. View task
4. exit // which would save as well.

//For Add task
With add task one can add tasks to a list. 
They will stay in the list until they are completed.

//For Completed Task
Once a task is completed from the Add task list, it will be off that list once its completed.

//View Tasks
will allow the user to see all the tasks that have been inputed.

//Exit
Will save and exit the program.

This system is great to track what needs to be done and once its complete it'll be moved out of that list. Also having the View Tasks is also good to go back and double check those tasks.
